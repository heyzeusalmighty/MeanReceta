# MeanReceta
Recipe manager using the MEAN stack

Have you ever gotten a hankering for Grandma's famous Christmas gumbo, tore through your scattered collection of hand written note cards of recipes only to discover the gumbo recipe is missing?  This happened to me once, it won't happen again.

This is a project to play with the MEAN stack.  I took the Angular-Fullstack template and built on top of that, learning conventions along the way.
